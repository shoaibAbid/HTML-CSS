        <h1 style="font-size: 60px; color: blue;">About Me</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">As an aspiring data and SQL developer, I bring a solid foundation in SQL query writing, database fundamentals, and data analysis to the table. My educational background and practical experience have equipped me with the skills necessary to contribute effectively to database projects. I am enthusiastic about the prospect of learning from experienced professionals and thrive in dynamic team environments. With a keen eye for detail and a passion for data-driven solutions, I am eager to embark on a journey of professional growth, leveraging my expertise to make meaningful contributions in the realm of database development.</p>
        <h2 style="color:red">Work Experience</h2>
        <p >During my internship at Falcon Xoft, I had the opportunity to actively engage in the intricacies of data modeling and SQL database development. One of my primary responsibilities was the construction of Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD), where I meticulously translated complex business requirements into comprehensive visual representations. This process involved a keen adherence to SQL and database principles, ensuring the accuracy and efficiency of the subsequent database structures. Building upon the ERD foundation, I derived relational schemas to establish the framework for seamless data integration.</p>
        <p>In addition to data modeling, I played a key role in the practical implementation of SQL through query writing. My responsibilities included crafting SQL queries for data validation and troubleshooting, where precision and attention to detail were paramount. This hands-on experience not only honed my SQL skills but also provided valuable insights into the practical challenges of database management. Through these tasks at Falcon Xoft, I gained a comprehensive understanding of the end-to-end process of database development, from conceptualization to implementation, setting a strong foundation for my future endeavors in the field.</p>
        <h2 style="color:red">Projects</h2>
        <p>
In my project focused on the Database Management of an Online Grocer on Coursera.org, I independently designed a relational database, showcasing my proficiency in database architecture and schema design. Constructing database tables from scratch highlighted my expertise in creating structured data storage, and successfully loading them with sample data from CSV files demonstrated my skills in data import and transformation. Through comprehensive testing using SQL queries, I ensured the accuracy and integrity of the database design, underscoring my commitment to delivering high-quality database solutions.</p>
        <p>At Falcon Xoft, I played a crucial role in the Ecommerce website Development project, where I designed a robust MySQL database structure, including tables, relationships, and constraints. Leveraging Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD), I developed a comprehensive model design, seamlessly integrating the e-commerce website with the MySQL database to ensure real-time data synchronization and secure data transactions. Additionally, my contribution to the Library Management Website project at the University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, involved designing a MySQL database structure with defined tables and relationships. The successful deployment of the website on an AWS EC2 instance, with configured port settings and enabled internet access, showcased my skills in database design and AWS deployment.You may click on the link for  <a href="anchors.html" style="color: green;">more information</a> </p>
