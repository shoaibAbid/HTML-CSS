        <h1>Further Information</h1>
        <p>In my internship at Falcon Xoft, I actively engaged in the intricacies of data modeling and SQL database development. Responsibilities included constructing Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD), translating complex business requirements into visual representations, and deriving relational schemas to establish database structures. I also played a key role in SQL query writing for data validation and troubleshooting, gaining practical insights into the challenges of database management.</p>
        <p>Simultaneously, on Coursera.org, I undertook a project on the Database Management of an Online Grocer. Independently designing a relational database showcased my proficiency in database architecture, schema design, and the creation of structured data storage. Testing the database design using SQL queries ensured data accuracy and integrity. Another project involved executing Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipelines in an Online ETL Project. Utilizing Python, Pandas, and SQLAlchemy, I demonstrated expertise in data migrations and transformations, configuring SQL Server and PostgreSQL environments for efficient data extraction.</p>
        <p>My contribution to Ecommerce website Development at Falcon Xoft further solidified my skills. Designing a robust MySQL database structure, integrating it seamlessly with the e-commerce website, and ensuring real-time data synchronization showcased my commitment to delivering high-quality database solutions. Additionally, I undertook a Library Management Website project at the University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore. Designing a MySQL database structure with defined tables and relationships, I successfully deployed the website on an AWS EC2 instance, showcasing my skills in both database design and AWS deployment. These diverse experiences have collectively shaped my proficiency in SQL, database management, and data-driven solutions.</p>
